I had a bunch of issues...
The first issue was getting the background image to have the opacity and color without changing the other items on top of the background.
A lot of issues came from trying to figure out how bootstrap works and what codes need to be added to the class to make it work. My nav bar was the hardest becasue I could not get it to extend the whole width of the page.

A few resources were used to help:
